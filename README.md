Hermes package for Sublime Text 3
===

*This package is in a stage before practical use.*

Hermes is a package for Sublime Text 3, which provides REPL and autocomplete in interaction with Jupyter kernels.

The concept of an editor extension communicating Jupyter kernels is inspired by @nteract's splendid Atom package [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/Hydrogen). However, I still love ST3 too so much that implements this package:)
