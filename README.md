Hermes
===

Hermes is a package for Sublime Text 3, which provides REPL and autocomplete in interaction with Jupyter kernels.

This package aims to be a heir of SublimeREPL and some part of code is taken over from it.

The concept of an editor extension communicating Jupyter kernels is inspired by @nteract's splendid Atom package [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/Hydrogen). However, I still love ST3 too so much that implements this package:)
